### Historical Data Analysis
Equip the AI to analyze past negotiations, learning from successful compromises, stalemates, and points of contention to refine future negotiation strategies.

### Stakeholder Communication
The AI generates concise post-negotiation summaries, detailing agreed-upon terms, potential concerns, and next steps to ensure all stakeholders are well-informed.

### Ethical & Compliance Check
Incorporate a module to ensure that all negotiations and suggested terms comply with industry regulations and adhere to the highest ethical standards.

### Simulated Negotiations
Implement a training mode allowing sales teams to simulate negotiations with the AI, enhancing their skills and preparing them for real-world scenarios.
